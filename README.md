## Design Adherence

### Colors
- Primary Blue: `hsl(217, 91%, 60%)` - Used for CTAs and brand elements
- Background: White with subtle gray tones
- Sidebar: Light gray background `hsl(0, 0%, 98%)`
- Text: Dark gray `hsl(220, 13%, 18%)`

### Typography
- Clean, modern sans-serif font
- Hierarchy: h1 (3xl-4xl), body (sm), labels (xs)
- Font weights: Regular (400), Medium (500), Semibold (600), Bold (700)

### Spacing & Layout
- Sidebar: 320px (80rem) collapsed to 64px (16rem)
- Max content width: 768px (3xl)
- Consistent padding: 16px-24px
- Border radius: 12px-16px for cards

### Component Behavior
- Smooth transitions (300ms)
- Hover states on interactive elements
- Active states for navigation items
- Loading states for AI responses

## Functionality

### Chat Flow
1. **New Chat Screen**: Greeting with suggestion cards
2. **Send Message**: User types and sends (Enter or click send button)
3. **Active Chat**: Messages appear in conversation view
4. **AI Response**: Simulated response after 1 second delay

### State Management
The app uses React Context to manage:
- Messages array (user and assistant messages)
- Chat history (recent conversations)
- Sidebar collapsed state
- Active chat status
- Selected AI model

### File Attachments
- Click paperclip icon to add files
- Files display in message with name and size
- Can remove individual attachments before sending

## Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Full sidebar visible
- **Tablet (768px-1024px)**: Sidebar collapsible via menu button
- **Layout**: Flexbox-based responsive grid
- **Typography**: Scales down on smaller screens

## Trade-offs & Decisions

1. **No Backend**: As specified, all chat functionality is client-side with simulated responses
2. **shadcn/ui vs MUI**: shadcn/ui and Tailwind were chosen for their flexibility and modern design capabilities. The components were customized to match the design requirements perfectly
3. **Context vs Zustand**: Used React Context for simplicity - Zustand would be better for larger apps
4. **File Upload**: Simulated file attachments (no actual upload) since no backend is required
5. **Animations**: Kept subtle to maintain performance while adding polish

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Functional components with hooks
- ✅ Reusable, logical component structure

- ✅ Proper prop types and interfaces
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions

## Browser Support
